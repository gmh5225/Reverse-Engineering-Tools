### Executable Detector:
If you want to determine the compiler used for something or find out what it was packed with, these are your best options. 

- **DiE:** Cross-platform and works well.
- **ExeInfo:** Offers better results but is exclusive to Windows. It might work with Wine, a Windows compatibility layer for Linux.

### Disassembly:
When it comes to disassemblers, the choice ultimately comes down to your personal preference. Typically, there are two popular options:

- **IDA:** The industry standard but expensive. (Cracked versions are available)
- **Ghidra:** A trusted and free alternative.

If you prefer a GUI frontend for the Rizin Framework, consider **Cutter**, which can also use the Ghidra decompiler.

### .NET Decompilation:
For .NET decompilation, several options are available:

- **dotPeek:** Offers excellent decompilation results.
- **dnSpy:** Great for Windows users.
- **Avalonia ilSpy:** Recommended for Linux users.

### APK & JARS:
These tools are particularly useful for Android reverse engineering:

**APKs:**
- **APKLab:** An Android reverse-engineering workbench for VS Code.
- **apk-mitm:** Used for automatic SSL certificate unpinning in APKs but not always reliable.
- **frida for Android:** For manual unpinning attempts.
- **apktool:** Converts APKs to bytecode.
- **jadx:** A GUI tool for decompiling APKs back into Java source code. It can even generate projects.
- **Android Studio & Genymotion:** Designed for Android development and provide easy access to ADB. They offer ARM translation and similar features for packages that don't support x86.

**JARS:**
- **java-decompiler:** Available with both CLI and GUI versions, similar to dnSpy for JAR files.

### Python:
- **pyinstxtractor:** Unpacks PyInstaller executables to bytecode and other dependencies.
- **Decompyle++:** A Python bytecode decompiler/disassembler.

### HTTP:
- **HTTPDebugger:** Best for Windows users.
- **Fiddler/Fiddler Everywhere:** Ideal for Linux users.
- **HTTPToolkit:** Great for Android debugging.

### Games:
- **UnityExplorer:** Can be loaded into Unity games to explore their contents at runtime.
- **CheatEngine:** Widely known for game hacking.
- **Il2CppDumper:** Used to dump Unity games built using IL2CPP.
- **Cpp2IL:** Similar to Il2CppDumper but seems to be compatible with more games based on user experience.
